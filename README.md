# PANACEA

The project is a simple script that reads an XML file from ADTool and generates a PRISM model for PRISM-games.

The project was tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu WSL2 with the following software versions:
- Python 3.12
- ADTool 2.2.2
- PRISM-games 3.2.1

## Installation

To install the project, you need to clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marini97/PANACEA.git
cd PANACEA
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ADTool

To generate the XML file, you need to use ADTool. You can download the software from the following link: [Download ADTool](https://satoss.uni.lu/members/piotr/adtool/) or with the following command:

```bash
wget https://satoss.uni.lu/members/piotr/adtool/ADTool-2.2.2-full.jar
```

To run the software, you need to use the following command:
```bash
java -jar ADTool-2.2.2-full.jar 
```
When creating the tree, every node needs to have a unique name and a description with the following fields:
```
Type: Action/Attribute/Goal
Action: if Type is Action then the action name
Cost: if Type is Action then the cost of the action
Time: if Type is Action then the time of the action
Role: Attacker/Defender
```
Example:
```
Type: Action
Action: exfiltrateData
Cost: 50
Time: 2
Role: Attacker
```
Some xml files are provided in the `trees` folder.

Once you have created the Tree, you can export it to an XML file to use it with the script.

### PRISM-games

To run the PRISM model, you need to use PRISM-games. You can download the software from the following link: [Download PRISM-games](https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/games/download.php)
or with the following command:

```bash
wget https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/dl/prism-games-3.2.1-linux64-x86.tar.gz
```
Unzip the file inside this project, specifying the correct path, with the following command:
```bash
tar -xvf prism-games-3.2.1-linux64-x86.tar.gz
```

Install the software with the following command:
```bash
cd prism-games-3.2.1-linux64-x86
./install.sh
```
To run PRISM-games: for Windows, double-click the short-cut; on other OSs, run `bin/xprism` for the GUI or `bin/prism` for the command-line version.


## Usage

To use the project, you need to run the script `main.py` with the following arguments:
- `--input` or `-i`: the path to the XML file from ADTool
- `--output` or `-o`: the path to the output file for the PRISM model
- `--props`: generate the properties for the PRISM model
- `--prune` or `-p`: name of the subtree root to keep
- `--time` or `-t`: generate a time-based PRISM model

```bash
python main.py --input input.xml --output output.prism --time
```

Then you can run the PRISM model with the following command:
```bash
prism-games-3.2.1-linux64-x86/bin/prism \
    -javamaxmem 1g \
    -cuddmaxmem 1g \
    output.prism \
    properties.props -prop 1 \
    -exportresults output/results.csv:csv \
    -exportstrat output/strat.dot
```
Change `-javamaxmem` and `-cuddmaxmem` values according to your system specifications and the size of the model.

Or you can run PRISM-games with the GUI with the following command:
```bash
prism-games-3.2.1-linux64-x86/bin/xprism
```
And then load the PRISM model and the properties file.
